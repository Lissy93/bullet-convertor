## About
When I take notes, I write lists in plain text, but when I come to publish those notes I need to convert them into markdown.
And this is just a super quick script that automates this process.

## Deployment
It's just a static HTML page, so serve it with any web server, CDN or static host.<br>
There's a demo hosted on GH Pages, at: [lissy93.github.io/bullet-convertor](https://lissy93.github.io/bullet-convertor)
