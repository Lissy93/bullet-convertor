# Bullet Convertor

When I take notes, I write lists in plain text, but when I come to publish those notes I need to convert them into markdown.
And this is just a super quick script that automates this process.

### Deployment
The easiest method, is to fork the repo, make any changes you like, then log in to Netlify and deploy your fork. 

Built as a vanilla JS app without any dependencies. Due to the simplicity of it, everything is just done in a single HTML file,
so deployment is as simple as just uploading it to any static hosting provider, CDN or web server.
